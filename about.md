**Hello,**

I'm NLP Researcher in Reading Comprehension task. Over the past year, I have been working to publish scientific paper on Question Generation topic. I hope to publish this paper at the end of 2021. Unfortunately, due to time constraint and limitation of computational resources, the works has to be suspended for a while. 

Currently, I'm focusing to build a data science portfolio that consist of wide-variety of machine learning tasks (e.g., classification, regresssion) that involved stuctured (tabular) and non-stuctured (vision and languages) data.

# Technical Skills
I have been actively using **Python** for my personal research project. To accelerate my works, I utilize various framework such as [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for general Deep Learning and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) for NLP.

# Research Experiences
- **(2020)** : LogDQN Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementation for Solving Hydrophobic-Polar Model Protein Folding Problem. ([link](https://alvinwatner.github.io/static/logdqn_hp.pdf))
- **(2021)** : Neural Question Generation with Alpha Tokens. ( _temporarily suspended_ )
